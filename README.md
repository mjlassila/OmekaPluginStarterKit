# Omeka Plugin Template

This repository contains the basic directory structure and files needed
for an Omeka plugin. In an effort to speed things up,
"conventional" code has been included where it makes sense - that is,
the boilerplate that almost all plugins will need. All code that
includes placeholder variable names or parameters is commented out in
the template files.

# Omeka Plugin Template

This repository contains the basic directory structure and files needed
for an Omeka plugin. In an effort to speed things up,
"conventional" code has been included where it makes sense - that is,
the boilerplate that almost all plugins will need. All code that
includes placeholder variable names or parameters is commented out in
the template files.

This template follows the class-based approach for initizliating the
plugin first used by John Flatness and CHNM, and then passed on to me
(David McClure) by way of Jeremy Boggs.

This formatting for this file is generated with the [Markdown] language
written buy John Gruber.
